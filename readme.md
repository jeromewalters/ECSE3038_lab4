In this assignment, the focus is on controlling LEDs using Arduino and HTTP. Specifically, an ESP32 board is utilized to manage the state of three LEDs. This is done by making a GET request to a server, which returns a response that is then used to set the LED states. Essentially, the ESP32 board acts as a client that sends a request to the server and receives a response, which it then interprets and acts upon by controlling the LEDs. By following this approach, it is possible to establish a reliable and effective means of remotely controlling LEDs using Arduino and HTTP.
